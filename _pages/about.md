Welcome to my homepage; I am  Junqiao Lv from Shanxi Province, China. I am a current master's student in orthopedics at Shanxi Medical University, and my research interests lie in the use of multi-omics/single-cell analysis to address the neuroimmunology of secondary spinal cord injury. You are cordially invited to engage in academic discussion with me.
